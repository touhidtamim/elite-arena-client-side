## 📝 Project Overview

Elite Arena is a professional-grade Sports Club Management System built to modernize and simplify how sports clubs operate. From member registration to court bookings, announcements to payments—Elite Arena provides a fully digitized ecosystem for managing day-to-day club activities with ease and efficiency.

## 🎯 Target Audience

- Sports club admins and managers
- Enthusiasts seeking court/session bookings
- Club members tracking their events and payments
- New users looking to register or explore sports facilities

## ❓ Problem We Solved

Traditional sports clubs often rely on manual systems—spreadsheets, paper registrations, in-person payments, and no centralized member management. These create friction, mismanagement, and poor user experience.

**Elite Arena solves this by offering:**

- A fully digital workflow
- Role-based access for admins, members, and users
- Transparent and streamlined court management
- Real-time announcements and coupon handling
